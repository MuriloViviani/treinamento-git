# Git Training
The ideia behind this training is that the participants will do some small tasks organized in a sequential way. I`ll be following up each submitted task and will do the required observations (If necessary)

The necessary tasks will be registered as [issues](https://github.com/MuriloViviani/treinamento-git/issues). If you have any doubts in the execution, fell free to ask about it in the comments
